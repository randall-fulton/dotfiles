* Dotfiles
Here's me dotfiles.

Emacs and Neovim config are symlinked, so they can be easily updated without having to invoke =home-manager=. Everything else has to be updated with =home-manager=.

** Bootstrap
On a new system, run the following to bootstrap =nix= and =home-manager=.
#+begin_src shell
  sh bootstrap.sh
#+end_src

** Updating config
After bootstrapping, and after any further changes to config, run the relevant "switch", based on system type.

Darwin:
#+begin_src shell
  darwin-rebuild switch
#+end_src

Linux:
#+begin_src shell
  home-manager switch
#+end_src
